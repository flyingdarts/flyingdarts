# Coding Standards & Best Practices

## General Principles

- Write code that is readable, maintainable, and self-documenting
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes

## Error Handling

- Always handle exceptions appropriately
- Use specific exception types rather than generic ones
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Don't swallow exceptions without good reason

## Code Organization

- Group related functionality together
- Use appropriate access modifiers (public, private, internal)
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- Use interfaces to define contracts
- Separate concerns (UI, business logic, data access)

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile code before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Minimize memory allocations in hot paths
- Consider async operations for I/O-bound tasks

## Security Best Practices

- Validate all inputs from external sources
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Store sensitive data securely (encrypted, hashed)
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Testing Requirements

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Write tests for edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Keep tests independent and repeatable

## Documentation Standards

- Document public APIs with clear examples
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Update README files when adding new features
- Document configuration options and their effects
